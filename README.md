# 1.Look at the data given below. Plot the data, find the outliers and find out  

Name of company	Measure X
Allied Signal	24.23%
Bankers Trust	25.53%
General Mills	25.41%
ITT Industries	24.14%
J.P.Morgan & Co.	29.62%
Lehman Brothers	28.25%
Marriott	25.81%
MCI	24.39%
Merrill Lynch	40.26%
Microsoft	32.95%
Morgan Stanley	91.36%
Sun Microsystems	25.99%
Travelers	39.42%
US Airways	26.71%
Warner-Lambert	35.00%


Solution:

Outliers :91.36%
Mean= 32.83 %
Variance()=284.25%
Standard Deviation ()=16.86%


















# 2.Answer the following three questions based on the box-plot above.

(i)What is the inter-quartile range of this dataset? (please approximate the numbers) In one line, explain what this value implies.

Ans : IQR =7 approx . This suggests that 50% of the data lies in the 5 to 12 range.

(ii)What can we say about the skewness of this dataset?

Ans: Distribution is positively skewed. 

(iii)If it was found that the data point with the value 25 is actually 2.5, how would the new  box-plot be affected?
Ans: Boxplot would have remained same but the outlier value 25 at the right side of the box plot
Won’t be there in the figure. 

# 3.Answer the following three questions based on the histogram above.

(i)Where would the mode of this dataset lie?

Ans : The mode of the dataset is between 5 to 10.

(ii)Comment on the skewness of the dataset.

Ans : Distribution is positively Skewed.	

(iii)Suppose that the above histogram and the box-plot in question 2 are plotted for the same dataset. Explain how these graphs complement each other in providing information about any dataset. 

Ans : Above Boxplot provides us information if there is any outlier in the dataset.
 Whereas the histogram tells about the clear shape of data, gives us more information about the frequency distribution of the data. Additional info of mode can be obtained from the histogram. For median we have to rely on boxplot as Q2 gives us the value of the median. Also histogram clearly shows us the data is positively skewed and there is a break in the histogram affirming the presence 
Of an outlier.


# 4.AT&T was running commercials in 1990 aimed at luring back customers who had switched to one of the other long-distance phone service providers. One such commercial shows a businessman trying to reach Phoenix and mistakenly getting Fiji, where a half-naked native on a beach responds incomprehensibly in Polynesian. When asked about this advertisement, AT&T admitted that the portrayed incident did not actually take place but added that this was an enactment of something that “could happen.” Suppose that one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected. What is the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number? (Assume independence of attempts.)

Ans: GIven Question gives us the following information=

one in 200 long-distance telephone calls is misdirected. Letmisdirected calls be ‘x’
Therefore, probality of such call P= 1/200
 We have to find atleast 1 in 5 calls are miss directed.
So,
Q = P(x=0)= No misdirected call. =1 -(1/200)  =199/200 = 0.995
P =  P(x=1)= 1 misdirected call. =1/200 
n =5
If there are no misdirected calls in 5 attempt. 
Then P(x=0) = (199/200)^5

So,Atleast one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong numbers
=1 - P(x=0)
=1 - (199/200)^5
=0.0247

Thus,
the probability that at least one in five attempted telephone calls reaches the wrong number = 0.0247 or 0.025.


# 5. Returns on a certain business venture, to the nearest $1,000, are known to follow the following probability distribution
x	P(x)
-2,000	0.1
-1,000	0.1
0	0.2
1000	0.2
2000	0.3
3000	0.1

(i)What is the most likely monetary outcome of the business venture?

Ans: It suggests that there is 60% chance is business will make positive returns. The highest probability is 0.3 that the business will make  $2000 implies business has good chance to make 
High returns.

(ii)Is the venture likely to be successful? Explain

Ans: Yes Because there is 60% chance that the venture will give a positive return.And only 20% chance of loss.

(iii)What is the long-term average earning of business ventures of this kind? Explain

Ans : Average = (-2000*0.1) +(-1000*0.1) +(0*0.2) +(1000*0.2) +(2000 *0.3) +(3000*0.1) =800
So, the long-term average earning for these types of ventures would be around $800.

(iv)What is the good measure of the risk involved in a venture of this kind? Compute this measure

Ans: The risk involved in this venture would be the total probability of negative returns 
Which is 0.1+0.1=0.2. So 20% chance of risk in a given venture.
